                        &quot;I think there is a deep and lasting beauty in simplicity, in clarity, in efficiency. True simplicity derives from much more 
                        than the simple absence of clutter and ornamentation.---- It is about bringing order to the complexity.&quot;

                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Simplicity is defined as: &ldquo;<em>freedom from complexity, intricacy, or division into parts</em>&rdquo;, in other words, it is maximizing the use of resources to mitigate complexity as much as possible, as Jonathan Ive (CDO Apple 2015-2019) said &ldquo;<em>It is about to bring order to complexity</em>&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Currently the systems are extremely complex and IT systems are even worse, because before it was believed that the more complex the solution, the better the quality, if the solution was simple, it was undervalued or technically discredited for that very reason.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Complex systems were not only created for wanting to make them complex, but also because of the lack of tools that would allow efficiency and the reduction of their components, for example, Smartphones are the simplicity of endless tools that a user should have with them. (Camera, PC, calendar, clock, maps...)</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Thanks to the new guidelines in design, development, planning and implementation, the aim is to simplify systems to the maximum, since it is well known that today the success of any new or implemented technology is that end users can use the system in a natural way, efficient and simple.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Simplicity is necessary to achieve these goals. Simplicity can be described as "the ability to create a low-cost, easy-to-use solution that meets the needs of the organization." Simplicity focuses on removing complexity from an organization's IT. The goal of simplifying is to make changes that haven't been done before; this means that large-scale changes must be made and implemented in every part of an organization's legacy system, for them to become a success. The bottom line of this approach is that the simpler the infrastructure, the easier and more streamlined time it will provide for every person who needs help with their IT service management issues.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Specifically, the work of the simplicity in IT infrastructure movement focuses on 4 main pillars:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Reliability and Availability: it focuses on systems being easily available and showing real data, some examples are cloud information managers such as Extreme Cloud IQ, Azure Resource Manager and Google Workspace.</li>
                        <li style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Security: focuses on how to inform users of threats, how to protect themselves, what to do if there is a vulnerability, etc. These can be evidenced as in different applications such as Windows Defender that alerts you that you can do to improve the security of the PC concisely with step by steps.</li>
                        <li style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Communication and Alert focuses on quickly and concisely informing and notifying users or work teams of any new developments in the system.</li>
                        <li style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Cost reduction: by optimizing resources, reducing complexity, and centralizing areas, operating times and costs are reduced.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;">Examples for Simplification:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <ol>
                        <li style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Applications would be used for a more efficient way.</li>
                        <li style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Applications would be optimized for efficiency.</li>
                        <li style="color:black !important; font-size: medium;">Complete IT infrastructure would be configured centrally by IT staff (CIOs) from any where.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;">However, everything that leads to simplifying solutions is hindered too much by different factors. Before, the problem that existed in the conjunction of systems with different computers that had different OS was almost impossible to solve any solution that could combine the computers in a single network so that they could work with each other, today thanks to the cloud it has been solved. Now the problems are due to other factors such as the high demand for data, the high demand for information in real time, the astronomical amount of interconnected equipment, in short, the problems to simplify the system today are focused on the manipulation of a almost infinite network of devices and the amount of data and information created and requested.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;">Under this factor today it is more than convenient that for the management of such a large system solutions are designed and implemented that provide simplicity to the end user for the management of these, because if you do not think about how to make the visualization, management and execution of actions is easy, simple and fast in the systems the solution created or implemented will be obsolete because users today do not want to waste time learning how to use a complex solution, they want it easy and dynamic.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;"></p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;">Simplicity tries to optimize complex systems by making them easy and simple to use, less is more. In addition, simplifying a solution is not to make it of lower quality, on the contrary, when simplifying, demanding parameters must be met, such as trust, security, communication, and efficiency, so that the simplified solution is optimal, then the success of the design or implementation of a solution IT is in its simplicity, without it being simple it will not be considered successful.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;">The simple solution is the foundation of modern IT. As a result, simplicity is a common keystone in all the major initiatives to address issues in IT. The majority of enterprise applications now provide some method of simplification, whether that's in the form of a simple UI, or an API that high-level languages can access.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;">Too many components and modules lead to these systems becoming complex systems with many components in many places and data silos. The complexity leads to security problems and thus delays, mismatches, errors, loss etc.</p>
                        <p style="color:black !important;; font-size: medium;">Simplicity means that all the data is readily available, users can access the data they are interested in quickly and easily, it can be done at any time and requires minimum intervention. It also provides a better user experience with regards to input parameters, selection of options and overall navigation.</p>
